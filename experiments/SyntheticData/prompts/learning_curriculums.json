  "prompt": "You are an intelligent curriculum designer within ScholéAI, an online platform where students learn AI with the help of AI.\n\nYour task is to generate preference pairs of learning plans for students, based on:\n- The ScholéAI knowledge graph (KG), which maps dependencies between AI concepts and modules.\n- Their explicit and implicit user data (provided in JSON): this includes learning history, pace, focus areas, and feedback.\n\nKnowledge graph:\n[GRAPH]\n\nFirst, infer each student’s:\n- Learning style: one of \"visual\", \"auditory\", \"read/write\", or \"kinesthetic\"\n- Student profile: one of \"confused\", \"struggling\", \"goal_oriented\", \"fast_paced\", \"curious_student\", \"social\", or \"passive\"\n\nThen, generate two learning plans:\n- \"chosen\": the optimal plan, fully aligned with the student's style, profile, goals, and knowledge gaps (according to the KG)\n- \"rejected\": a realistic but less ideal alternative — it should still be coherent and make sense, but it should miss or misalign with some personalizations (e.g. modality mismatch, wrong pacing, or less suitable progression)\n\nEach learning plan must begin with this sentence:\n\"From your past interactions with Olé, your learning style appears to be [LEARNING_STYLE], and your learning behavior aligns with the [STUDENT_PROFILE] profile.\"\n\nThen continue with a structured, ordered list of 3–6 AI-related learning modules. Each module should have:\n- A clear title\n- A modality (e.g. \"Video walkthrough\", \"Coding exercise\", \"Short quiz\", \"Reading notebook\", \"Live discussion\")\n- An optional 1-line description for context\n\nImportant:\n- The \"rejected\" plan should not be absurd — just slightly misaligned (e.g. too passive for a goal-oriented student, or text-heavy for a visual learner)\n- Ground all content in the AI education domain (e.g. modules on supervised learning, backpropagation, transformers, etc.)\n- Ensure the difference between plans is pedagogically meaningful to support preference learning\n- Keep formatting consistent and JSON parseable\n\nOutput format example:\n\n{\n  \"user_id\": 7,\n  \"chosen\": \"From your past interactions with Olé, your learning style appears to be visual, and your learning behavior aligns with the goal_oriented profile.\\n\\nLearning Plan:\\n1. Visual Walkthrough: 'How Neural Networks Learn' (animated video with interactive layers)\\n2. Coding Lab: 'Train Your First Classifier' (Jupyter-based with guided visual outputs)\\n3. Diagram Session: 'Gradient Descent Demystified' (step-by-step graph-based breakdown)\\n4. Quiz: 'Concept Check – Visual Learners Edition' (drag-and-drop + diagrams)\",\n  \"rejected\": \"From your past interactions with Olé, your learning style appears to be visual, and your learning behavior aligns with the goal_oriented profile.\\n\\nLearning Plan:\\n1. Reading: 'Theory of Neural Networks' (textbook excerpt)\\n2. Coding Lab: 'Build a Classifier' (minimal visuals)\\n3. Text-based Explanation: 'Understanding Gradient Descent'\\n4. Quiz: 'Standard MCQ on Learning Rates'\"\n}"
