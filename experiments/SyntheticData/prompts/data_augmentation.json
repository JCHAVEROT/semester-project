  "prompt": "You are given a list of JSON objects, each representing a user’s interaction with ScholéAI — an AI-powered personalized online learning platform for Data Science learners. Each object follows this schema:\n\n{\n  \"user_id\": int,\n  \"explicit_data\": { ... },\n  \"implicit_data\": { ... }\n}\n\nEach user interacts with a curriculum built on the following knowledge graph, where:\n- Each node is a learning module.\n- A directed edge `A -> B` means A is a prerequisite of B (users should ideally complete A before B).\n\nKnowledge Graph:\n[GRAPH]\n\nYour task is to perform data augmentation: enrich each user's data with additional synthetic preferences and behavior signals that are realistic, diverse, and coherent with both the existing data structure and the knowledge graph. You must follow these rules:\n\n1. Preserve the `user_id` and all existing fields in each object. Do not remove or modify any existing content.\n\n2. Augment the data by adding new entries to:\n   - `ratings_on_modules`: add realistic ratings for new modules not already rated. Only include modules that logically follow the user's current curriculum, respecting the knowledge graph dependencies.\n   - `approval_of_content_modifications`: simulate 1–2 new approval or rejection decisions.\n   - `initial_curriculum_state`: you can add new modules from the knowledge graph.\n   - `drag_and_drop_curriculum_edits`: add optional edits whose indices must be correct with respect to `initial_curriculum_state`.\n   - `timestamped_clicks`: append additional clicks with newer ISO 8601 timestamps.\n   - `drop_off_events`, `content_adaptation_requests`, `interactions_with_tutor`: simulate thoughtful new activity based on the user's current progress or struggles.\n   - `time_on_task_per_module`: add time entries for prerequisite or follow-up modules consistent with the knowledge graph.\n   - `number_of_retries_on_quizzes`, `response_times`: add realistic quiz behaviors, retry counts, and response durations.\n\n3. Respect the original schema strictly:\n   - Do not change field names or value formats.\n   - All new timestamps must follow the ISO 8601 format (e.g., \"2025-05-01T15:04:05Z\").\n   - Numerical values must remain within their defined ranges.\n   - Do not invent any new field names, modules, or quiz identifiers — use only those found in the knowledge graph.\n\n4. The augmented data should reflect a diverse set of realistic learner behaviors, including:\n   - Fast learners, methodical students, easily distracted users, and advanced learners skipping basic modules.\n   - Variation in preferred content formats, reflection depth, curriculum edits, and tutor interaction patterns.\n\n5. Ensure added data is pedagogically plausible:\n   - Do not simulate a user engaging with a module before its prerequisites.\n   - Quizzes, notes, or tutor questions should reference modules the user has encountered or is currently progressing through.\n\n6. Return the same list of JSON objects, with each object augmented as described. Do not wrap the output in any structure or add explanations — return only the final list of enriched JSON objects."
