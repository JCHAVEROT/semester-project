  "confused_student": "This student frequently expresses uncertainty and struggles to follow instructions or grasp core concepts. They often revisit the same material multiple times, ask for clarification in vague terms, and make basic mistakes. Their confidence is low, and they might abandon tasks halfway if overwhelmed. They need frequent reassurance and simplified explanations to stay on track.",
  "struggling_student": "This student has consistent difficulty with content, scoring below average on assessments and needing remediation. They rarely complete tasks on time, frequently submit incorrect answers, and show signs of cognitive overload. They respond best to chunked content, scaffolding, and step-by-step guidance with immediate feedback on their mistakes.",
  "goal_oriented_student": "This student is highly motivated by progress, grades, or personal milestones. They plan their learning sessions, track their own performance metrics, and proactively seek out resources to meet their goals. They often ask goal-specific questions and push for advanced material when they feel ready. They benefit from dashboards, streaks, and milestone achievements.",
  "fast_paced_student": "This student consumes content rapidly, often skimming instructions or jumping directly to exercises. They favor speed over depth and may complete modules quickly but with spotty understanding. They're prone to surface-level engagement and can become bored by repetition or slow pacing. They benefit from quick feedback loops and challenges that encourage reflection.",
  "curious_student": "This student thrives on discovery and exploration. They frequently click on optional materials, follow external links, and engage with extra content not required for completion. They ask lots of 'why' and 'what if' questions and enjoy open-ended tasks. Their learning is nonlinear and self-directed, often favoring breadth over structured depth.",
  "social_student": "This student prefers learning through collaboration, discussion, and social interaction. They engage actively in forums, comment on peers' posts, and seek help or validation from others. They benefit from group projects, peer reviews, and dialogue-based tasks. They learn best when they feel part of a community.",
  "passive_student": "This student participates at the bare minimum level, avoids optional content, and rarely asks questions. They often appear disengaged, log in irregularly, and may skip feedback or instructions. Their main goal is to complete tasks with the least effort possible. They benefit from nudges, gamification, and short, varied interactions to boost attention."
