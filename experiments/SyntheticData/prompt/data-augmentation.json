  "prompt": "You are given a list of JSON objects, each representing a user’s interaction with ScholéAI, an AI-powered personalized online learning platform for Data Science learners. Each object follows this format:\n\n{\n  \"user_id\": int,\n  \"explicit_data\": { ... },\n  \"implicit_data\": { ... }\n}\n\nYour task is to perform **data augmentation**: enrich each user's data with **additional synthetic preferences and behavior signals** that are realistic, diverse, and coherent with the existing data structure. You must follow these rules:\n\n1. Preserve the `user_id` and all existing fields. Do **not** remove or alter any existing content.\n2. Add new entries in:\n   - `ratings_on_modules`: introduce ratings for new modules not already rated.\n   - `approval_of_content_modifications`: add 1–2 new approval or rejection events.\n   - `drag_and_drop_curriculum_edits`: optionally add more reordering actions.\n   - `timestamped_clicks`: append additional clicks with newer timestamps.\n   - `drop_off_events`, `content_adaptation_requests`, `interactions_with_tutor`: simulate additional meaningful activity.\n   - `time_on_task_per_module`: add new modules with time data or expand on existing ones.\n   - `number_of_retries_on_quizzes` and `response_times`: add new quiz attempts and per-question times.\n\n3. Ensure all added data strictly respects the original schema:\n   - Do not change field names or value formats.\n   - Use ISO 8601 format for all new timestamps.\n   - All numerical fields must remain within their specified range.\n   - Do not invent new field names or structures.\n\n4. The synthetic data should reflect diverse user behaviors and preferences:\n   - Vary between cautious learners, fast skimmers, curious explorers, and users struggling with content.\n   - The augmentation should appear natural — not overfilled or too uniform.\n\n5. Return the **same list of JSON objects**, with **each object augmented** with realistic additional data, and preserving all existing fields.\n\nYou must not wrap the output in any other structure or add commentary — just return the final list of enriched JSON objects.\n- Do not add any additional text, answer with the data in json format only."
